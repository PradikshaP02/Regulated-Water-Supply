Description

	This system gives information about water supply area wise and the user can find the details about supply duration, pressure and quality of water and can send his/her valuable feedback if interested which is considered advantageous as there is bi-directional communication. 
	Our controlled water supply system will not abruptly terminate the water flow to the customer at the time of scarcity, instead share the available resource to all the customers in need. 
	This system also includes billing, analysis and estimation of the resources for efficient supply in the future. 
	We try to reduce the manual intervention through this project and increase the revenue with limited wastage.
